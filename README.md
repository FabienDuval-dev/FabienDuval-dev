- 👋 Hi, I’m @FabienDuval-dev (Fabien Duval)
- 👀 I love computers (and physics). I'm interested in many areas of computing (from hardware to software).
  I started programming in the 90s, using the BASIC language (QBASIC to be precise).
  I know the syntax of languages like C and Python.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to develop in Java, and I'm also learning web development.
- 💞️ Of course, I'd like to try to collaborate on some projects, but I don't think I'm strong enough to be a very good collaborator at the moment.
  I'll start by studying what you've done (and you've done a lot!). I'm making progress and I'll never stop.
