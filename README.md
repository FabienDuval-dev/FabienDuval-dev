- 👋 Hi, I'm @FabienDuval-dev (Fabien Duval)
- 👀 I love computer science (and physics). I'm interested in many areas of computer science (from hardware to software).
- I started programming in the 90s, using the BASIC language (QBASIC to be precise).
- I know the syntax of some languages ​​like C and Python
- 🌱 I did a training on web development (with Java), and got an official certificate in web development.
- 💞️ Of course, I would like to try to collaborate on some projects, but I don't think I'm strong enough to be a very good collaborator at the moment.
I'll start by studying what you've done (and you've done a lot!). I'm making progress and I'll never stop.
- But for now, I'm preparing for the computer science aggregation. So I won't do any major projects for the moment.
